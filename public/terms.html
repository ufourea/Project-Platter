<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">4. PAYMENT TERMS<br>
4.1 Payment Methods</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">In order to use certain Site Services, Client must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method. Client hereby authorizes Project Platter and its Affiliates Limited to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Client, to store credit card and banking details as Client's method of payment for Services, and to charge Client's credit card (or any other form of payment authorized by Project Platter or mutually agreed to between Client and Project Platter).
By providing Payment Method information through the Site, Client represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) Client is legally authorized to provide such information to us; (b) Client is legally authorized to perform payments using the Payment Method(s); and (c) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Client's use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law. When Client authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Client represents, warrants, and covenants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement cannot be collected from Client's Payment Method(s), Client is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.
We reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Engagement, if we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions, or if we have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the credit card company, bank, PayPal or other payment method as used by you, or as used by your Client if you are a Freelancer. You agree that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by instructing   to (and   will have the right to) charge an applicable    Account, and any other accounts you hold with us, offsetting any amounts determined to be owing, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your credit card, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. Failure to pay for reimbursements of chargebacks is cause for termination of the applicable Account.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">4.2 US Dollars and Foreign Currency Conversion</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">The Site and the Site Services operate in US Dollars. If Client's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than US Dollars and requires currency conversion, the Site may display foreign currency conversion rates. Project Platter, or other Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to US Dollars. These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Please note that the wholesale currency conversion rates at which we obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site. Client, at its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to US Dollars at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in US Dollars and either Project Platter,  , or another Affiliate does not support the foreign currency or Client does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site,   or an Affiliate will charge Client's Payment Method in US Dollars and Client's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by Client's Payment Method provider. Client's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method used to fund a cross-border payment even when no currency conversion is involved. Client's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at Client's sole risk. We are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than US Dollars. We are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments via wire transfer, check or automated clearinghouse to and from the Account.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">5. Records of Compliance</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Client and Freelancer will each (1) create and maintain records to document satisfaction of their respective obligations under this Agreement and any Service Contract, including, without limitation, their respective payment obligations and compliance with tax and employment laws, and (2) provide copies of such records to Project Platter upon request. Nothing in this subsection will be construed as requiring Project Platter to supervise or monitor a User's compliance with this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, or a Service Contract.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">6. Relationship with Project Platter</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Project Platter is not a party to the dealings between Client and Freelancer, including posts, proposals, screening selection, contracting, and performance of our Services. Project Platter does not introduce Freelancers to Clients or help Freelancers find Engagements. Project Platter merely makes the Site Services available to enable Freelancers to identify and determine the suitability of Clients for themselves and to enable Clients to identify and determine the suitability of Freelancers for themselves. Project Platter does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Freelancer or Freelancer's work. Project Platter does not set Freelancer's work hours, work schedules, or location of work, nor is Project Platter involved in determining if the Freelancer Fees will be set at an hourly or fixed rate for a Service Contract. Project Platter will not provide Freelancer with training or any equipment, labor, or materials needed for a particular Service Contract. Project Platter does not provide the premises at which the Freelancer will perform the work.

Project Platter does not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes for Client or Freelancer; each of which is solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority in any nation with respect to Freelancer's performance, and Client's acceptance, of Freelancer Services.
Project Platter is not required to and may not verify any feedback or information given to us by Freelancers or Clients, nor does Project Platter perform background checks on Freelancers or Clients.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that Project Platter may provide information on the Site about a Freelancer or Client, such as feedback, a strength or risk score, geographical location, or verification of identity or credentials. However, such information is based solely on data that Freelancer or Client voluntarily submits to Project Platter and does not constitute and will not be construed as an introduction, endorsement, or recommendation by Project Platter; Project Platter provides such information solely for the convenience of Users.</h4>

Without limiting Project Platter's other remedies, if you engage in actions or activities that circumvent the Site or otherwise reduce fees owed Project Platter or our Affiliates under this Agreement, you must pay Project Platter for all fees owed to Project Platter and our Affiliates and reimburse Project Platter for all losses and costs (including any and all time of Project Platter's employees) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees. In addition, violations of this Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions.
When your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, and other material you keep on the Site. If practicable, Project Platter will retain this information along with all your previous posts and proposals for a period of one year from the date of termination to give you ample time to institute an appeal of our decision through the process described in the subsection titled "Disputes with Project Platter." If you appeal our decision through that process within one year, Project Platter will retain your information until such dispute is resolved. If you fail to appeal our decision within one year, Project Platter may delete your information including data, messages, files, and other material you keep on the Site.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">13.1 Enforcement of Agreement</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Project Platter has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or revoke your access to the Site and Site Services if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement or violated our rights or those of another party. Without limiting Project Platter's other remedies, we may suspend or close your Account, use self-help in connection with our rights to reclaim funds, and refuse to provide any further access to the Site or the Services to you if (a) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or other Terms of Service; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, other Users, or Project Platter. Once we suspend or close your Account, you may not access any parts of the Site, including data, messages, files, and other material saved on the Site and you may not continue to use the Site under a different Account or reregister under a new Account. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law. You understand that any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Project Platter will have no liability whatsoever.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">13.2 Consequences of Agreement Termination</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Termination of this Agreement and/or closing of your Account will not relieve Client of the requirement to pay for Freelancer Services performed prior to the effective date of the termination or thereafter for any Service Contracts executed before termination of this Agreement, which fees and expenses, together with any applicable taxes, Client hereby authorizes Project Platter to charge to its Payment Method pursuant to Section 4 (Payment Terms). Subject to the applicable Dispute Resolution Policies, Project Platter will pay Freelancer, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 (Payment Terms) for all time recorded in the Time Logs incurred prior to the effective date of the termination or thereafter for any Service Contracts executed before termination of this Agreement.
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we will notify you if we close your Account, unless we believe, in our sole judgment, that giving notice may cause damage. You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of User's Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows: IF PROJECT PLATTER DECIDES TO SUSPEND OR CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, PROJECT PLATTER HAS THE RIGHT BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR SUSPENDED OR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, AND (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR CLOSURE.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">13.3 Survival</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after the Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions protecting Confidential Information, requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates.</h4>

The section headings in this Agreement are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. Even though Project Platter drafted this Agreement, you represent that you had ample time to review and decide whether to agree to the terms of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation of this Agreement arises, no presumption or burden of proof will arise favouring or disfavouring you or Project Platter because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.</h4>

The terms and conditions of this Agreement, however, will govern and supersede any term or condition in a side agreement that purports to expand Project Platter's obligations or restrict Project Platter's rights under this Agreement.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">14.4 Modifications</h3>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">14.5 No Waiver</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">The failure or delay of either party to exercise or enforce any right or claim does not constitute a waiver of such right or claim and will in no way affect that party's right to later enforce or exercise it, unless such party issues an express written waiver, signed by a duly authorized representative of such party.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">14.6 Assignability</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">User may not assign this Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without Project Platter's prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Project Platter (and, for the purposes of this subsection, a written instrument will expressly exclude electronic communications such as email and electronic notices, but will include facsimiles). Project Platter may freely assign this Agreement without User's consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this subsection will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">14.7 Severability</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion thereof will be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;font-weight:600;">14.8 Force Majeure</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure to perform or any delay in performance of any obligation hereunder due to labor disturbances, accidents, fires, floods, telecommunications or Internet failures, strikes, wars, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental requirements and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other similar conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party. The time for performance of such party will be extended by the period of such delay. Irrespective of any extension of time, if an event of Force Majeure occurs and its effect continues for a period of 60 days, either the party may give to the other a 30-day notice of termination. If, at the end of the 30 day period, the effect of the Force Majeure continues, the Agreement will terminate.</h4>
