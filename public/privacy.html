<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">1. Information Collection</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Users of the Service may be Clients (anyone utilizing the Project Platter platform to request services to be performed by a Freelancer) or Freelancers (any company, individual user, or groups of associated individual users or companies utilizing the Project Platter platform to offer services to Clients). Freelancers may also operate as an Agency (a legally recognized entity with the ability to hire and/or contract) with other Freelancers. </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Information You Provide to Us </h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Personal Information</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">In the course of using the Service, we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, postal address and phone number.    
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Payment Information</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card, PayPal or other financial account information, and billing address. </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Identity Verification</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth, or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement. </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    General Audience Service</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18. If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that Project Platter has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us. </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Non-Identifying Information/Usernames</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information regarding your use of the Service, and general project-related data (“Non-Identifying Information”). We may aggregate information collected from ProjectPlatter.com registered and non-registered users (“Project Platter Users”). We consider usernames to be Non-Identifying Information.  Usernames are made public through the Service and are viewable by other Project Platter Users.  </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name). But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but Project Platter will treat the combined information as Personal Information. 
Information Received from Third Parties 
We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service).  If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes logins and signups through social media websites.
Information Collected from Users Automatically
We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service. This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.
The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other unique device identifiers (“Device Identifier”) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.  Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Service.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">The technology used to collect information automatically from Project Platter Users may include the following:</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Cookies</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service and to track your compliance with any Project Platter applicable policies) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how Project Platter Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Project Platter Users and web traffic routing on the Service). You may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Service.
Certain web browsers and certain browser add-ons such as Adobe Flash may provide additional data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to cookies, and some of the content included on our Sites may make use of this type of storage.  For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit link (see website).</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Web Beacons</h3>  
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Sites is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how Project Platter Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">•    Embedded Scripts</h3>  
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online service you visit.  There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many websites and online services, Project Platter does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.  To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com. </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Work Journals</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">As part of the Service, we collect information about a Freelancer’s work on a project for a Client.  This feature is known as Work Journal.  Work Journals include information provided by the Freelancer, such as a memo, as well as automatically gathered information about work on a project, such as number of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes and regularly taken screenshots (which may include a webcam picture of you if you have not disabled this feature in your settings).  Work Journals from www.ProjectPlatter.com.
We will share information contained in Work Journals with the relevant Client and with any manager or administrator of any applicable Freelancer Agency.  We inform Freelancers each time we capture information for Work Journal.  As set forth in our Terms of Service, End User License Agreement, and help pages on the Site, a Freelancer may choose to block or delete the screenshot and associated data for a recorded work interval, but then the Freelancer may not be paid for that work interval.  ProjectPlatter may use general information from Work Journals for statistical analysis, product development, marketing, and research.</h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">User Profiles</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, and may include Personal Information, photographs, examples of your work, information on work previously performed via the Service, feedback/rating information and other information, including your username (“Profile”).  The information in your Profile may be visible to all Project Platter Users and the general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your Project Platter Profile.  You may edit certain information in your Profile via your account and may choose to limit who is able to view certain content you post to your Profile.  Clients and Agencies of associated individual users or companies may also have the opportunity to create an organization Profile. If, in any case, you believe that an unauthorized profile has been created about you, you can request for it to be removed by contacting us.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Community Forums</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">The Service may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, on blogs, through interactive features Project Platter and through other communication functionality ("Community Forums"). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post questions, comments, or other content (collectively, "User Forum Content"). Please note that certain information, such as your name and Profile may be publicly displayed on the Service along with your User Forum Content. Please note that your use of Community Forums is subject to the Project Platter Forum Rules and our Terms of Service.
Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public -- others will have access to your User Forum Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your User Forum Content or use Community Forums to link to your Profile, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.
To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Testimonials</h3>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Work Listings through the Service</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">If you choose to post a work listing via the Service as a Client, the contents of such listing will be viewable publicly, unless you designate the listing as only viewable through the Service or as private using the settings available on the applicable website. Work listings include information such as budget, location, history of work listing(s) by the Client, the names of other Freelancers performing work for the Client, Client feedback and rating information and timing of project performance.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Feedback</h3>

Please note that any feedback you provide via the Service or feedback provided about you is publicly viewable via the Service.  On very rare occasions, we may remove feedback pursuant to our Feedback Removal Policy.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Email to Friends and Referral Program</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Project Platter lets you send project postings to friends via email.   Project Platter also offers the ability to send friends emails about providing or purchasing services through the Service.  If you choose to use either feature, your friend’s email address will be used to send the requested posting and your email address will be used to copy you on the message to your friend or to send the message on your behalf.</h4>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">Social Networking Services</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">You may register to join the Service directly via the Service or by logging into your account with a third party social networking service (“SNS”) via our Service (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn and other third-party services that let you sign in using your existing credentials with those services). If you choose to register via an SNS, or to later link your account with the Service to your account with an SNS, we will use the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your name, email address, gender and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your account.  Note that the information we collect from and through an SNS may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the SNS and the permissions you grant to us in connection with linking your account with the Service to your account with an SNS. Other than what we may share with the SNS as described below, the Personal Information SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service, and ProjectPlatter is not responsible for it.
The ProjectPlatter Service also may permit additional interactions between it and a third party website, service, or other content provider, such as enabling you to “like” or share content to a third-party SNS.  If you choose to “like” or share content, or to otherwise share information from or via our Service with a third-party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Service (and we may have access to information about you from that third party). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with third parties through SNS or similar features are governed by the respective privacy policies of those third parties.
You represent that you are entitled to use your SNS account for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the SNS, and without obligating Project Platter to pay any fees or making Project Platter subject to any usage limitations imposed by such SNS.  You can disable the link between your Project Platter account and your SNS account at any time through the “Settings” section of our Service. Please note that your relationship with any SNS is governed solely by your agreement(s) with such SNS. If your SNS account terminates, then functions enabled through the link between your Project Platter account and your SNS account will terminate as well.</h4>

If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an SNS or similar interactive feature or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances. </h4>

When you enter sensitive information (such as tax identification number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use HTTP strict transport security to add an additional layer of protection for our Project Platter Users.  But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data, Project Platter cannot ensure and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.} (will happen soon)  </h4>

The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight:600;">10. Phishing</h3>
